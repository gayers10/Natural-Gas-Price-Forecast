# Natural-Gas-Price-Forecast
This project examines monthly natural gas prices from January 1997 to August 2020 using time series analysis techniques to fit the data to the correct model and test forecast accuracy. The data was split into train/test sets to check the accuracy of the model forecast on the test data. I performed a Box-Cox Transformation of the data to stabilize the variance, and then differenced at lag one to remove trend from the data so that the data became stationary. Using this stationary data, I fit the transformed data to SARIMA models to find which model gave the best fit. From this a $SARIMA(0,1,0)x(1,0,0)$ model was identified as the best, and the corresponding coefficient was estimated. I performed diagnostic checks to ensure my model was a correct fit for the data and finally forecast the future values. The forecast values were within the 95% prediction interval of the model, although due to high uncertainty, the prediction interval was quite wide.
